**ACTION FORMAT REQUIREMENT:**
- You MUST use one of the following two action formats:
  1. Search action: `search[keywords]` where keywords is a space-separated list of search terms describing the product
  2. Click action: `click[button_text]` where button_text is exactly the text of a clickable element from the available actions

**Examples of valid actions:**
- `search[men's shorts drawstring elastic waist gym]`
- `search[women jeans polyester spandex x-large]`
- `click[next >]`
- `click[back to search]`
- `click[buy now]`
- `click[B09Q5ZHRVM]`

**Important rules:**
- Search keywords MUST NOT be empty
- Click button_text MUST match exactly (case-insensitive) one of the available clickable elements
- Always use lowercase for action names: `search` and `click`, NOT `Search` or `CLICK`

Once you've finished your reasoning, you should choose an admissible action for current step and present it within <action> </action> tags."""
